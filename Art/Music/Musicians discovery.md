 	# Hania Rani
	Polish pianist, her song "Today It Came" deeply touched my with its simplicity.
	If minimalism was a music genre, that song would be the best example, with just a few separate touches of the piano's keyboard, Rani send you shivering to another dimension.

 # David August
	German Electronic artist, I haven't listened to much of his work, but I keep coming back to his Boiler Room performance. Long flight, deep focus time ? This is the music for it :

 	# Ril√®s
	Probably my favorite artist of all time. I got inspired by his hardwork during one of the lowest moments of my life. He studied english and learned to make music from scratch by himself, and decided to make a song each week for a whole year from his bedroom (Rilesundays). The results were fascinating, as every week he came up with a masterpiece, exploring various musical territories.
	The first of his songs I listened to was Snakes, before listening to his whole discography on repeat, adding a new song to the list each week.
