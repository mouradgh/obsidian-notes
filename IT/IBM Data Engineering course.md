What's the difference between a Database and a Datawarehouse ?
DW is a columnar DB (indexed according to column values in contrast to the row-oriented storage used by databases)


There are 2 types of Data Repositories : 
- Transactional - OLTP (Online Transaction Processing System) : Store high volume day to day operational data
Ex : Google Cloud SQL
- Analytical - OLAP (Online Analytical Processing System) : Conduct complex Data Analytics
Ex : Google Big Query
